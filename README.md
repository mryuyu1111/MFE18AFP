AFP: Characterization of factor performance by economic regime

Ideas of factor rotation and factor timing have drawn the attention of researchers in recent years. A well-referenced paper on “momentum crashes” (reference 4) highlights that factors that do well over time can do poorly in certain regimes. We propose to explore this idea systematically. The first step is to develop a model to determine the state of the economic cycle (reference 1 is a good read): recession, recovery, expansion, and slowdown. The model can use macroeconomic, technical and sentiment-based indicators (such as those used in reference 6). The model may be a classification model if the intent in to broadly identify discrete economic regimes, or a regression model measuring the degree of expansion (-ve if the economy is contracting). The second step is to measure factor performance and discover the functional relationship between economic cyclicality and factor performance. This relationship is not expected to be linear, which makes the problem challenging and worth exploring in an AFP.
